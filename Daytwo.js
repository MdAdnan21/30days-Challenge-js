// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

    Multiplication of two number is ${number1 * number2}
    Divided of two number is ${number1 / number2}
    Remainder of two number is ${number2 % number1}`)

    // 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

    // 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

    console.log(number1 > number2 ? "Number1 is Positive" : "Number2 is Negative")
